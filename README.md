## Ideas

1. First open-source AI-powered WWW Search engine <br/>
… see Comparison of web search engines - Wikipedia <br/>
… as YaCi has basically no public web available (just searchlab.eu) <br/>
… so the only opensource that works is Gigablast and it uses no AI, …

2. Free code and private user data <br/>
… that’s the goal! We’d like to index billions of pages

3. Perfect privacy - we don’t track you, you can check the code <br/>
… we don’t save your queries unless you ask us to do it for you <br/>
… neither the searched pages can track premium users

4. Usable UX to find something hidden (no need to leave the page) <br/>
… optimised for web, news and malware forensics without leaving the search

5. Type and refine queries automatically and see the result immediately <br/>
… customise and improve the search by topics and even web sites

6. Not really a competitor for Google, focus on security <br/>
… your swiss army cyber-security knife for the web
